INTRODUCTION:-
A *File Integrity Checker (FIC)* is a tool or process used to ensure that a file has not been altered, corrupted, or tampered with after its creation or transmission. It compares the *current state* of a file to a *known good state* (reference value) using *cryptographic hash functions* like MD5, SHA-256, or SHA-512.
DISCREPTION:-
* *Detects unauthorized changes* (e.g., malware injection, tampering)
* *Ensures data consistency* during backups, transfers, or storage
* *Supports compliance* with standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA
* *Prevents integrity attacks* (e.g., MITM attacks on downloaded files)
1. *Hash Generation (Baseline)*
2.*Verification*
3. *Common Algorithms Used*

* *MD5* – Fast but not secure (collision-prone).
* *SHA-1* – Better than MD5, but deprecated for strong security.
* *SHA-256 / SHA-512* – Strong and widely used in integrity checks.

TECHNOLOGIES:-

* *Tripwire* – Enterprise-level FIC, monitors critical system files.
* *AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)* – Linux-based integrity checker.
* *HashMyFiles* – Windows GUI tool for generating hashes.
* *OpenSSL* – Command-line hashing tool.
* *FCIV (File Checksum Integrity Verifier)* – Microsoft utility.
